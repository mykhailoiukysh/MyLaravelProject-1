#### Step 6 - Short Service Names
Stuck? No worries: http://bit.ly/fabien-best-practices

A) Rename the service `blogger_blog.mailer.contact_mailer` to something
   much shorter and update your app to work.

B) Make sure the Twig extension service also has a short name.

**GOAL**
The site still works! There's no reason to make *your* service names long!

**EXTRA CREDIT**

Make the `blogger_blog.emails.contact_email` parameter shorter too!
Change everywhere this needs to be changed.
