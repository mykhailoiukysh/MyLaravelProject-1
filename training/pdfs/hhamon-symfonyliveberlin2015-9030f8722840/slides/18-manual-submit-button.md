#### Step 18 - Manual Submit Button
Stuck? No worries: http://bit.ly/fabien-best-practices

A) Remove the `submit` button field in `CommentController::createCommentForm`

B) Just render the `<button type="submit"` manually
in `Comment/_form.html.twig`

**GOAL**
The site still works! The buttons in forms just don't really
help us much in most cases.
