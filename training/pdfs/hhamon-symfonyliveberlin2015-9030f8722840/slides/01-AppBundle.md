Stuck? No worries: http://bit.ly/fabien-best-practices

Our First Goal (DON'T DO THESE MANUALLY!)

A) Remove the extra `Blogger` namespace/directory

B) Rename `BloggerBlogBundle` to `AppBundle`

... since this is a lot of work, let's cheat:

git checkout step02-constant origin/step02-constant

**GOAL**
Go to `http://localhost:8000` and see the site still working!
