#### Step 9 - Simplify routes
Stuck? No worries: http://bit.ly/fabien-best-practices

A) Make the homepage route name much shorter. Let's call it `homepage`!

B) Update `base.html.twig` for the new route name

**GOAL**
The site still works! There's no reason to give *your* routes long names.

**EXTRA CREDIT**

Update all of the route names to be short!
